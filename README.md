===============

### Getting started

The project uses Gradle (the new Android build system) which is fully compatible with the Android Studio v.3.2. 
To get started download Android Studio from [here]() and setup the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html),
then click Import Project.


### Optional 
If you need to build from the command line, first you need to install Gradle:

    $ brew install gradle 
  
Then in the root directory of the project run `gradle build`, the APK will be available in the follwing directory `helpful-android/app/build/apk`
